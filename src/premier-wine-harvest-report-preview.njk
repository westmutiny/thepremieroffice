  <p>A quick and thorough Introduction to the methods and terminology used in the Harvest Reports from The Premier Office Of Wine & Weather:</p>

  <p>The analysis of any extreme weather events affecting the southern hemisphere in 2025. In this report we discuss the impact of Tropical Cyclone Alfred and the wildfire season in all of the regions examined in the report.</p>

  <p>The harvest analysis of 13 wine regions in the southern hemisphere at locations within Australia, New Zealand, Chile, and Argentina. One of these regional reports, focused on the Barossa Valley region of Australia, is offered below as a preview.</p>

  <p>An appendix which outlines foundational principles that are useful when applying the insight offered in this report to tasting analysis.</p>
  <p>Please Enjoy The Following Sample from the 2025 Southern Hemisphere Wine Harvest Report by The Premier Office of Wine & Weather. The eBook and Audiobook will be available from preferred outlets soon.</p>

  <p>Barossa Valley, Australia<br>
  The Barossa Valley wine region in Australia experienced climate variability that resulted in an annual average entropy of 3.10 bits. When comparing the overall weather profile to previous vintages, the closest historical match is the year 2017, with notably weaker correlations to a previous vintage than is seen in other regions.<br>
  Soil moisture, precipitation, and humidity measures caused the majority of climate variability in the early stages of the vineyard growth year. Measurements associated with disease pressure on the grapevines provided the largest contributions to climate variability during the beginning of grape development. Longwave and shortwave solar radiation, soil moisture, and temperature contributed the most climate variability as the region approached harvest. Longwave solar radiation most strongly correlated with the vintages of 2014 through 2016. Shortwave solar radiation most strongly correlated with the 2011 and 2021 vintages. Soil moisture most strongly correlated with the vintages of 2017 and 2019. Precipitation was too variable to reliably correlate with a previous vintage in a way that provides an accurate description of precipitationâ€™s influence on the harvested vintage. Temperatures in the region most strongly correlated with 2017. Elements of disease pressure were highly variable in their correlations with previous vintages, with correlations emerging in relation to the range of vintages in 2012 through 2014 as harvest approached.<br>
  The 2025 Barossa Valley vintage received significant effect pressure from monthly interval increases in longwave and shortwave solar radiation, temperature, and dew points. Effect pressure from significant monthly interval decreases occurred in precipitation, relative humidity, as well as longwave and shortwave solar radiation.These effect pressures on climate variability combined to result in the annual average entropy of 3.10 bits. The 2017 vintage from the Barossa Valley region, the strongest correlation to the 2025 vintage, was commonly rated 93 points by experts and is currently considered suitable for enjoyment but not yet at peak condition, indicating that the 2025 vintage may take more than eight years to mature.</p>
